/**
 * Context Isolation Test
 * 
 * This file contains manual verification tests for context isolation
 * between ChatLoadingContext and TrainingLoadingContext.
 * 
 * These tests should be run manually in the browser to verify:
 * 1. Chat loading state doesn't affect training loading state
 * 2. Training loading state doesn't affect chat loading state
 * 3. Both contexts can be loading simultaneously without interference
 * 4. Error states are isolated between contexts
 */

  // Test 1: Independent Loading States
  test1_independentLoading: {
    description: "Verify chat and training loading states are independent",
    steps: [
      "1. Start a training session (training should show loading)",
      "2. While training is loading, send a chat message (chat should show loading)",
      "3. Verify both loading indicators appear in their respective areas",
      "4. Verify completion of one doesn't affect the other"

  // Test 2: Concurrent Operations
  test2_concurrentOperations: {
    description: "Verify both systems can operate simultaneously",
    steps: [
      "1. Start a training session and wait for it to become active",
      "2. Send a chat message while training is active",
      "3. Send a training message while chat is processing",
      "4. Verify both operations complete independently"

  // Test 3: Error Isolation
  test3_errorIsolation: {
    description: "Verify errors in one system don't affect the other",
    steps: [
      "1. Trigger an error in the training system (e.g., invalid session)",

  // Test 4: Context Provider Hierarchy
  test4_providerHierarchy: {
    description: "Verify proper context nesting and availability",
    steps: [
      "1. Open browser dev tools and check React components",
      "2. Verify ChatLoadingProvider wraps chat components",
      "3. Verify TrainingLoadingProvider wraps training components",
      "4. Verify contexts are available where needed"
