  - Responsive visual feedback during resize

### 3. `TrainingStartScreen.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Initial screen shown before training begins
- **Props**: `onStartTraining`, `onShowBulkCreation`, `isLoading`
- **Features**: 
  - Single session and bulk session creation options
  - Loading state handling

### 4. `TrainingChatArea.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main chat interface during active training
- **Props**: Messages, training status, handlers for various actions
- **Features**:

### 6. `BulkSessionCreation.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Modal for creating multiple training sessions
- **Props**: Session configurations and handlers
- **Features**: 
  - Dynamic session configuration management
  - Add/remove session configurations
  - Bulk creation with progress indication

### 7. `ChatPage.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main page component orchestrating all sub-components
- **Features**: 
  - Integrates all sub-components
  - Manages layout and resize functionality
  - Handles bulk session creation modal

## New Hooks Created

### 1. `useResizePanel.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages panel resizing logic
- **Returns**: Resize state, handlers, and refs
- **Features**: 
  - Mouse event handling for resize
  - Panel width constraints
  - Global cursor management during resize

### 2. `useTrainingHandlers.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralizes all training-related business logic
- **Returns**: Training state and action handlers
- **Features**: 
  - Training session lifecycle management
  - Message handling and database persistence
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Bulk session creation
  - Thread selection and loading

## Updated Files

### `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Before**: 1000+ lines of complex component logic
- **After**: Clean, minimal wrapper with proper context setup
- **Improvement**: 95% reduction in file size, much better maintainability

## Technical Improvements

### Type Safety
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Added proper type imports for `TrainingStateType`
- Corrected database schema requirements (added missing `groupId` field)

### Code Organization
- Separated concerns into logical components
- Extracted business logic into custom hooks
- Improved component reusability

### Error Handling
- Centralized error display logic
- Consistent error messaging and styling
- Proper error type classification

### Performance
- Reduced bundle size through better code splitting
- Improved component re-render optimization
- Better memory management with proper cleanup

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
✅ ESLint: All issues resolved
✅ Next.js build: Successful
✅ All components properly exported and imported
