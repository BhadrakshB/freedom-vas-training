# Kiro MVP Slicer - Phase 1 Requirements Distillation

**Purpose:** Transform any comprehensive Kiro specification into a minimal viable Phase 1 implementation  
**Focus:** Core Kiro artifacts - requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md  
**Goal:** Get from complex spec to working prototype in hours, not weeks

---

## Core Philosophy

**The MVP Slice Principle:** Every complex software project has a simple core that delivers the primary value. Find that core, build it first, then iterate.

**Example Transformations:**
- **E-commerce platform:** 50 features ‚Üí "Browse products, add to cart, checkout"
- **Task management app:** 30 features ‚Üí "Add task, mark complete, view list"  
- **API service:** 20 endpoints ‚Üí "Create, read, update, delete one resource"
- **Content management:** 40 features ‚Üí "Create post, edit post, display posts"

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Kiro Specification

**Read these core files in order:**
1. **requirements.md** - Understand all features and user stories
2. **design.md** - See the full technical architecture
3. **tasks.md** - Review the complete implementation plan

**Key Questions:**
- What is the core value proposition?
- What's the simplest possible version that still provides value?
- Which features are "nice to have" vs "must have"?
- What's the minimum viable user workflow?

### Step 2: Identify the Core Value Loop

**Find the Essential User Journey:**
```
User Input ‚Üí Core Processing ‚Üí Valuable Output
```

**Examples:**
- **Blog Platform:** Write post ‚Üí Save to database ‚Üí Display on web page
- **API Service:** Receive request ‚Üí Process data ‚Üí Return JSON response
- **File Processor:** Load file ‚Üí Transform data ‚Üí Save result
- **Web App:** User action ‚Üí Business logic ‚Üí Updated interface

**Strip Everything Else:** Authentication, configuration, multiple formats, advanced features, etc.

### Step 3: Create Phase 1 Requirements

**Use this simplified structure:**

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Phase 1 Requirements

## Core Value Proposition
**What it does:** [One sentence description]

## Essential Features (Phase 1 Only)
1. [Core feature 1 - simplified]
2. [Core feature 2 - simplified]  
3. [Core feature 3 - simplified]

## User Stories (Phase 1 Only)
- As a [user], I want [core action] so that [primary benefit]
- As a [user], I want [essential function] so that [key value]
- As a [user], I want [basic capability] so that [main outcome]

## Acceptance Criteria
**Scenario: Happy Path**
Given [simple setup]
When [user does core action]
Then [system delivers value]

## What We're NOT Building (Phase 1)
‚ùå [Advanced feature] - Phase 2
‚ùå [Complex feature] - Phase 3
‚ùå [Nice-to-have] - Future enhancement
```

### Step 4: Simplify the Design

**Create minimal design.md:**

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Phase 1 Design

## Architecture (Simplified)
- [Component 1] - [Core responsibility]
- [Component 2] - [Essential function]
- [Component 3] - [Basic capability]

## Technology Stack (Minimal)
- [Primary technology] - [Why chosen]
- [Essential library] - [Core functionality]
- [Basic storage] - [Simple persistence]

## Data Models (Essential Only)
- [Core entity] - [Key attributes only]
- [Primary relationship] - [If absolutely necessary]

## What We're NOT Designing (Phase 1)
‚ùå [Complex architecture] - Phase 2
‚ùå [Advanced patterns] - Phase 3
‚ùå [Optimization] - Future enhancement
```

### Step 5: Distill the Tasks

**Create focused tasks.md:**

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Phase 1 Tasks

## Setup (30-60 minutes)
- [ ] 1.1 Create basic project structure
- [ ] 1.2 Set up minimal dependencies
- [ ] 1.3 Create entry point

## Core Implementation (2-4 hours)
- [ ] 2.1 Implement [core feature 1]
- [ ] 2.2 Implement [core feature 2]
- [ ] 2.3 Implement [core feature 3]
- [ ] 2.4 Connect components together

## Basic Testing (1-2 hours)
- [ ] 3.1 Test happy path workflow
- [ ] 3.2 Test basic error scenarios
- [ ] 3.3 Validate core functionality

**Total Estimated Time: 4-8 hours**

## What We're NOT Implementing (Phase 1)
‚ùå [Complex feature] - Phase 2 (estimated +X hours)
‚ùå [Advanced capability] - Phase 3 (estimated +Y hours)
‚ùå [Nice-to-have] - Future (estimated +Z hours)
```

## Ruthless Feature Elimination

**Always Eliminate in Phase 1:**
- ‚ùå **Configuration systems** - Use hardcoded defaults
- ‚ùå **Multiple input/output formats** - Pick one format
- ‚ùå **User authentication** - Skip unless core to value
- ‚ùå **Complex data persistence** - Use files or simple storage
- ‚ùå **Advanced error handling** - Basic error messages only
- ‚ùå **Performance optimization** - Make it work first
- ‚ùå **Logging and monitoring** - Console output only
- ‚ùå **Customization options** - One way to do things
- ‚ùå **Integration with external systems** - Standalone first

**Common Simplifications:**
- **Database ‚Üí File storage** (JSON, CSV, text files)
- **Complex framework ‚Üí Simple library** (Flask vs Django)
- **Rich UI ‚Üí Basic interface** (CLI, simple HTML, basic desktop)
- **Multiple algorithms ‚Üí Single approach** (one method, one model)
- **Real-time ‚Üí Batch processing** (process on demand)
- **Multi-user ‚Üí Single user** (no user management)

## Quality Validation

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] **Delivers core value** - User gets the main benefit
- [ ] **Complete workflow** - End-to-end functionality works
- [ ] **4-8 hour implementation** - Quick to build and test
- [ ] **Extensible foundation** - Easy to add Phase 2 features
- [ ] **Proves concept** - Validates the idea works

**Red Flags (Scope too big):**
- üö© More than 8 hours estimated implementation
- üö© More than 5 core components needed
- üö© Requires complex setup or configuration
- üö© Multiple external dependencies or services
- üö© User workflow has more than 5 steps

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The "Just One More Feature" Trap:**
- ‚ùå "We just need authentication for it to be useful"
- ‚ùå "It's not complete without a database"
- ‚ùå "Users will expect a proper UI"
- ‚úÖ **Instead:** Build the core, get feedback, then add features

**The "It's Not Professional" Trap:**
- ‚ùå "We can't show this to users, it's too basic"
- ‚ùå "It needs proper error handling first"
- ‚ùå "The code quality isn't good enough"
- ‚úÖ **Instead:** Perfect is the enemy of good, ship the MVP

**The "Technical Debt" Trap:**
- ‚ùå "We need to architect this properly from the start"
- ‚ùå "Let's use the right database from day one"
- ‚ùå "We should implement proper patterns"
- ‚úÖ **Instead:** Simple code that works, refactor in Phase 2

## Success Timeline

**Typical MVP Slice Timeline:**
- **Hour 1:** Analyze full Kiro spec, identify core value
- **Hour 2:** Create Phase 1 requirements.md (simplified)
- **Hour 3:** Create Phase 1 design.md (minimal)
- **Hour 4:** Create Phase 1 tasks.md (focused)
- **Hours 5-12:** Implement Phase 1 (4-8 hours)
- **Hour 13:** Test and validate core functionality

**Total: 1-2 days from complex spec to working prototype**

## Conclusion

**The Kiro MVP Slicer transforms any comprehensive specification into an actionable Phase 1 that:**
- ‚úÖ **Delivers core value** in hours, not weeks
- ‚úÖ **Proves the concept** with real working software
- ‚úÖ **Enables rapid iteration** based on user feedback
- ‚úÖ **Reduces project risk** by validating assumptions early
- ‚úÖ **Builds momentum** with quick wins

**Process Summary:**
1. **Analyze** the full Kiro spec (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
2. **Identify** the core value loop (input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output)
3. **Eliminate** everything except essential features
4. **Create** simplified Phase 1 versions of all three documents
5. **Validate** scope is 4-8 hours of implementation
6. **Implement** and get real user feedback

**Remember:** The goal isn't to build the perfect application. The goal is to build the simplest thing that delivers value, then iterate based on real usage and feedback.

**Start simple. Ship fast. Iterate based on reality.**
