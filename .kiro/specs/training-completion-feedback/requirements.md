## Introduction

### Requirement 3

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant trainee, I want visual feedback about the current training status, so that I understand what phase of training I'm in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is 'in_progress' THEN the system SHALL maintain normal chat functionality
