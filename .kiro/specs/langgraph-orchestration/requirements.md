# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive LangGraph orchestration system that manages the entire AI training simulator workflow. The orchestrator coordinates multiple AI agents (scenario generator, persona generator, guest simulator, feedback agent) and handles session state management, database operations, and RAG search functionality. This replaces the current ad-hoc agent coordination with a structured, stateful workflow that ensures proper sequencing and error handling throughout the training session lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a training platform administrator, I want a centralized orchestration system that manages the entire training workflow, so that all AI agents work together seamlessly and training sessions are properly coordinated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training session is initiated THEN the orchestrator SHALL check if an existing session exists in the database
2. IF an existing session is found THEN the orchestrator SHALL load the persona and scenario data and route to the Guest_Simulator
3. IF no existing session is found THEN the orchestrator SHALL route to the Guest_Scenario_Generator
4. WHEN the orchestrator encounters an error THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide appropriate feedback
5. WHEN the orchestrator completes a workflow THEN it SHALL properly clean up resources and update session state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant trainee, I want the system to automatically generate appropriate scenarios and personas for my training session, so that I receive relevant and challenging practice scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no existing session is found THEN the Guest_Scenario_Generator SHALL be invoked to create a new scenario
2. WHEN a scenario is generated THEN the system SHALL perform RAG search to retrieve relevant SOPs and scripts
3. WHEN RAG search is complete THEN the Guest_Persona_Generator SHALL create a persona based on the scenario and SOPs
4. WHEN persona generation is complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL route to the Guest_Simulator with the generated content
5. IF scenario or persona generation fails THEN the orchestrator SHALL retry or provide fallback content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant trainee, I want to interact with a realistic guest simulator that maintains consistent behavior throughout the session, so that I can practice handling real-world customer service scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Guest_Simulator is active THEN it SHALL maintain the generated persona and scenario context throughout the interaction
2. WHEN the trainee responds to the guest THEN the simulator SHALL evaluate the response and continue the conversation appropriately
3. WHEN an issue is resolved or the trainee exits THEN the orchestrator SHALL route to the Feedback_Agent
4. WHEN an issue is not resolved THEN the simulator SHALL continue the interaction loop
5. WHEN the simulator encounters an error THEN it SHALL maintain session state and allow for recovery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant trainee, I want to receive comprehensive feedback after my training session, so that I can understand my performance and learn how to improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training interaction concludes THEN the Feedback_Agent SHALL analyze the complete conversation history
2. WHEN generating feedback THEN the agent SHALL reference relevant SOPs and company policies retrieved during RAG search
3. WHEN feedback is generated THEN it SHALL include specific examples from the conversation and actionable recommendations
4. WHEN feedback is complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL update the session state and route to the end state
5. IF feedback generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide basic performance summary as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the orchestration system to properly manage database operations and session persistence, so that training sessions can be resumed and data is not lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for existing sessions THEN the Check_DB_Tool_Call SHALL query the database efficiently
2. WHEN session data is found THEN it SHALL be properly deserialized and validated before use
3. WHEN new session data is created THEN it SHALL be persisted to the database with proper error handling
4. WHEN the orchestrator updates session state THEN changes SHALL be committed to the database atomically
5. IF database operations fail THEN the orchestrator SHALL implement retry logic and graceful degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the RAG search functionality to efficiently retrieve relevant SOPs and training materials, so that AI agents have access to current company policies and procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RAG search is initiated THEN the RAG_Search_for_SOPs SHALL query the Pinecone vector database
2. WHEN search queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized for relevance to the current scenario
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance and filtered for quality
4. WHEN RAG search is complete THEN the results SHALL be formatted appropriately for downstream agents
5. IF RAG search fails THEN the system SHALL use cached or default SOP content as fallback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestration system to provide comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestrator transitions between states THEN it SHALL log the transition with relevant context
2. WHEN agents are invoked THEN their inputs and outputs SHALL be logged for debugging
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full stack traces and context information
4. WHEN performance metrics are available THEN they SHALL be collected for monitoring
5. WHEN the orchestrator completes THEN it SHALL log session summary statistics
