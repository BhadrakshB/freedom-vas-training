# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the isolation between training sessions and normal chat sessions in the AI Training Simulator. Currently, there appears to be interference between the two modes, particularly around loading states and session management. The goal is to ensure complete separation so that training activities don't affect the main chat interface and vice versa.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant user, I want training sessions to have their own independent loading states, so that I can clearly distinguish between training activities and normal chat operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Start Training" THEN the system SHALL display a training-specific loading indicator
2. WHEN training is loading THEN the main chat interface SHALL remain unaffected and not show any training-related messages
3. WHEN the main chat is loading THEN the training panel SHALL not display any loading states or messages
4. WHEN training is active THEN the main chat SHALL show no indication that training is in progress

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant user, I want training sessions to operate completely independently from normal chat sessions, so that I can use both features without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training session is active THEN the main chat SHALL remain fully functional for normal conversations
2. WHEN I'm using the main chat THEN training session state SHALL not be affected
3. WHEN training session ends THEN the main chat SHALL continue operating normally without any state changes
4. WHEN I switch between training and chat THEN each SHALL maintain their independent state and context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant user, I want clear visual separation between training and chat loading states, so that I always know which system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is loading THEN the loading indicator SHALL be visually distinct from chat loading indicators
2. WHEN training is loading THEN the loading indicator SHALL appear only in the training panel area
3. WHEN chat is loading THEN the loading indicator SHALL appear only in the main chat area
4. WHEN both systems are idle THEN no loading indicators SHALL be visible in either area

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a virtual assistant user, I want training session management to be completely isolated from chat session management, so that actions in one don't affect the other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a training session THEN the chat session state SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN I end a training session THEN the chat session SHALL continue with its previous state
3. WHEN chat session is reset or cleared THEN the training session SHALL maintain its current state
4. WHEN training session encounters an error THEN the chat session SHALL remain unaffected and functional
