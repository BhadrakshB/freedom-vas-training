# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a new adapter class that handles document ingestion and embedding generation for any type of data or text content. The adapter will use Google's Gemini embedding model (`models/embedding-001`) to generate high-quality embeddings that can be used for semantic search and retrieval in the AI Training Simulator platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified document ingestion adapter, so that I can easily convert any text content or document into embeddings using Google's Gemini model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides text content THEN the adapter SHALL generate embeddings using the Google Gemini `models/embedding-001` model
2. WHEN a developer provides document metadata THEN the adapter SHALL preserve and associate the metadata with the generated embeddings
3. WHEN the embedding generation fails THEN the adapter SHALL provide clear error messages and handle failures gracefully
4. WHEN multiple documents are processed THEN the adapter SHALL support batch processing for efficiency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the adapter to support various document types, so that I can ingest SOPs, training materials, scripts, and other content types seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is provided THEN the adapter SHALL accept documents with different content types (text, markdown, structured data)
2. WHEN document metadata is provided THEN the adapter SHALL validate and normalize metadata according to the existing DocumentMetadata interface
3. WHEN content preprocessing is needed THEN the adapter SHALL provide text cleaning and normalization capabilities
4. WHEN chunking is required THEN the adapter SHALL support splitting large documents into manageable chunks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the adapter to integrate with the existing Pinecone service, so that generated embeddings can be stored and retrieved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the adapter SHALL format them for direct integration with the existing PineconeService
2. WHEN the adapter is used THEN it SHALL be compatible with the existing Document and DocumentMetadata interfaces
3. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the adapter SHALL provide a consistent interface that can replace the current hash-based embedding approach
4. WHEN the adapter is initialized THEN it SHALL use the same Google Gemini configuration as other parts of the system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor the embedding generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the adapter SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the adapter SHALL handle timeouts and connection failures gracefully
3. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the adapter SHALL validate inputs and provide descriptive error messages
4. WHEN processing large batches THEN the adapter SHALL provide progress tracking and partial failure handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the adapter to be performant and cost-effective, so that embedding generation doesn't become a bottleneck or expensive operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple documents THEN the adapter SHALL batch API calls to minimize request overhead
2. WHEN identical content is processed THEN the adapter SHALL provide optional caching to avoid duplicate API calls
3. WHEN large documents are processed THEN the adapter SHALL optimize chunk sizes for the Gemini embedding model
4. WHEN the adapter is used THEN it SHALL provide metrics on token usage and API costs
