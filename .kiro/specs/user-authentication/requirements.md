# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication system for the AI Training Simulator platform. The system will provide secure login and signup functionality using Firebase Authentication, supporting both email/password and Google OAuth authentication methods. The authentication page will serve as the entry point for users to access the training platform, with automatic redirection to the dashboard upon successful authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password, so that I can access the AI training simulator platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the authentication page THEN the system SHALL display a signup form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid email and password credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new Firebase user account
3. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect the user to the dashboard
4. WHEN account creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
5. IF the email is already registered THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the account already exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log in using my email and password, so that I can access my training sessions and progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the authentication page THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to switch between login and signup modes
2. WHEN a user enters valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user with Firebase
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. IF the user enters incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message without revealing whether the email exists

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using my Google account, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating a separate password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the authentication page THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign in with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google sign-in button THEN the system SHALL initiate Google OAuth flow
3. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create or authenticate the user account
4. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. IF Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to be automatically redirected to the dashboard when I visit the auth page, so that I don't see unnecessary login forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user visits the authentication page THEN the system SHALL check their authentication status
2. IF the user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them to the dashboard
3. WHEN checking authentication status THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. IF authentication check fails THEN the system SHALL display the authentication form

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear visual feedback during authentication processes, so that I understand the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits authentication forms THEN the system SHALL display loading states on buttons
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable form inputs to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN the page is loading authentication state THEN the system SHALL display a centered loading spinner
4. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL remove loading indicators before redirecting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication page to match the existing design system, so that I have a consistent experience across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication page renders THEN the system SHALL use the project's existing Tailwind CSS classes
2. WHEN displaying form elements THEN the system SHALL follow the project's input and button styling patterns
3. WHEN showing error messages THEN the system SHALL use consistent error styling with other components
4. WHEN displaying the page layout THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles used throughout the project
5. IF the project uses shadcn/ui components THEN the system SHALL utilize appropriate UI components for consistency
