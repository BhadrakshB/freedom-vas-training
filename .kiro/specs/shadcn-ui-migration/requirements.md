# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing custom UI components in the AI Training Simulator to use shadcn/ui components. The goal is to replace custom-built components with a consistent, accessible, and well-maintained design system while preserving all existing functionality and improving the overall user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace custom UI components with shadcn/ui components, so that the application has a consistent design system and improved maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all custom UI components SHALL be replaced with shadcn/ui equivalents
2. WHEN shadcn/ui is installed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes
3. WHEN components are migrated THEN they SHALL follow shadcn/ui design patterns and accessibility standards
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the bundle size SHALL not significantly increase (less than 20% increase)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to maintain the same functionality after the migration, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the ChatInterface THEN all chat functionality SHALL work identically to before
2. WHEN viewing feedback displays THEN all performance insights and recommendations SHALL be displayed correctly
3. WHEN using the training panel THEN all training controls and status indicators SHALL function as expected
4. WHEN interacting with forms and inputs THEN all validation and submission behavior SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved visual consistency and accessibility, so that the interface is more professional and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any component THEN it SHALL follow consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly accessible
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all components SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN components SHALL be responsive and maintain usability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper shadcn/ui setup and configuration, so that the components integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shadcn/ui is installed THEN it SHALL be properly configured with Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN components are added THEN they SHALL be installed using the shadcn/ui CLI
3. WHEN styling conflicts occur THEN they SHALL be resolved in favor of shadcn/ui patterns
4. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the development workflow SHALL support easy addition of new shadcn/ui components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced visual feedback and loading states, so that I have better understanding of system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are loading THEN appropriate shadcn/ui loading indicators SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed using shadcn/ui alert components
3. WHEN actions are successful THEN appropriate feedback SHALL be provided using shadcn/ui components
4. WHEN forms have validation errors THEN they SHALL be displayed using shadcn/ui form validation patterns
