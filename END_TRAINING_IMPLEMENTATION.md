# End Training Session Implementation

## Overview
Added functionality to allow users to manually end a training session while it's in progress, which will trigger the feedback generation workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Training Actions (`src/app/lib/actions/training-actions.ts`)
- Added `endTrainingSession` function that:
  - Takes scenario, persona, and conversation history as parameters
  - Invokes the workflow with `status: "completed"` to force completion
  - Triggers feedback generation
  - Returns feedback and completion status

```typescript
export async function endTrainingSession(request: EndTrainingRequest): Promise<EndTrainingResponse>
```

### 2. Enhanced TrainingStatusIndicator (`src/app/components/TrainingStatusIndicator.tsx`)
- Added "End Training" button that appears when status is "ongoing"
- Button includes:
  - Square icon to indicate stopping
  - Loading state ("Ending..." text)
  - Proper disabled state during processing
  - Clean styling consistent with the design system

### 3. Updated Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added `handleEndTraining` function that:
  - Validates training state
  - Calls the endTrainingSession action
  - Updates training status to "completed"
  - Sets session feedback for display
  - Handles errors appropriately
- Added `isEndingTraining` state for UI feedback
- Connected the TrainingStatusIndicator with end training functionality

### 4. Fixed FeedbackDisplayPanel (`src/app/components/FeedbackDisplayPanel.tsx`)
- Resolved React hooks issues by extracting collapsible sections into separate components
- Created `AreasForImprovementSection` and `GeneralSuggestionsSection` helper components
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing hook usage

## User Experience

### When Training is Active:
1. User sees "Training in Progress" status indicator
2. "End Training" button appears next to the status
3. User can click "End Training" at any time

### When Ending Training:
1. Button shows "Ending..." with disabled state
2. System invokes workflow with completed status
3. Feedback is generated and displayed
4. Training status changes to "completed"
5. Feedback panel opens automatically

### Error Handling:
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- User sees appropriate error messages
- Training can be retried or restarted if needed

## Technical Details

### Workflow Integration:
- Uses existing LangGraph workflow
- Forces completion by setting `status: "completed"`
- Triggers feedback generation node
- Maintains conversation history and context

### State Management:
- Integrates with existing TrainingContext
- Uses proper TypeScript interfaces
- Maintains consistency with existing patterns

### UI Components:
- Follows existing design patterns
- Uses shadcn/ui components
- Responsive and accessible
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Testing Considerations

The implementation is ready for testing with:
1. Start a training session
2. Send a few messages
3. Click "End Training" button
4. Verify feedback is generated and displayed
5. Verify training status changes to "completed"

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Confirmation dialog before ending training
- Save partial progress option
- Training session analytics
- Export training results
